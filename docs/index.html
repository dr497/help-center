							value: "How do pools rebalance?",
							label: "<p>First Rebalance i.e Initaliziation Let\x26rsquo;s take the Ecosystem Pool as an example. Until December 22nd only USDC can be deposited in the pool, so let\x26rsquo;s say that on December 22nd just before it\x26rsquo;s initaliziation, people deposited 100,000 USDC in the pool. The breakdown of the pool would be as follow:\n   Coin Size Spot price     FIDA 0 $0.1   SRM 0 $1.2   SOL 0 $1.6   LQID 0 $0.2   USDC 100,000 $1    Before it\x26rsquo;s initaliziation the pool contains USD$ 100,000 so it needs to buy $ 100,000\/4 = $ 25,000 worth of each token, so after it\x26rsquo;s initaliziation the pool will be as follow:\n   Coin Size Spot price     FIDA 250,000 $0.1   SRM 20,833.3 $1.2   SOL 15,625 $1.6   LQID 125,000 $0.2   USDC 0 $1    Weekly Rebalance Let\x26rsquo;s keep the previous example, let\x26rsquo;s assume that the spot prices have changed to the following:\n   Coin Size Spot price USD worth     FIDA 250,000 $0.2 50,000   SRM 20,833.3 $1.1 22,916.63   SOL 15,625 $1.8 28,125   LQID 125,000 $0.25 31,250    The pool is now worth $132,291.63 and will need to rebalance to allocate $ 132,291.63 \/ 4 = $ 33,072.9 in each asset. So the pool will have to sell some of it\x26rsquo;s FIDA to buy SRM, SOL and LQID. The pool will buy from the orderbook at the best average entry price. After the rebalance the pool will look like:\n   Coin Size Spot price USD worth     FIDA 165,364.5 $0.2 33,072.9   SRM 30,066.27 $1.1 33,072.9   SOL 18,373.83 $1.8 33,072.9   LQID 132,291.6 $0.25 33,072.9    Redemptions and creations are disabled during pool rebalances\n A pool will not increase it’s position in one asset by more than 5% to avoid the pool taking too large positions in an asset which has decreased significantly in price\n When do pools rebalance?

							label: "<p> What is Serum?    Serum is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Solana. Solana is a highly performant blockchain that allows Serum to have 100% on-chain orderbooks, network fees that costs a fraction of a penny, and lightning fast execution speeds.\nThe Serum ecosystem is completely permissionless where anybody can create their own tokens, list their own markets, and create their own GUI. To learn more about Serum visit https:\/\/projectserum.com\n   What is Bonfida?    Bonfida is the full product suite that bridges the gap between Serum, Solana, and the user. We are the flagship Serum GUI and the first to bring Solana data analytics to the field. Our API is used by some of the largest market makers in the space and has seen a growth of requests of 25% week over week.\nRead more about us at https:\/\/bonfida.medium.com\/bonfida-what-we-do-dc56c5c3779e\n   Is Bonfida safe?    Bonfida users maintain 100% control over their keys and coins. Bonfida will never be able to control or seize user funds.    How do I deposit fund?    Bonfida supports several wallets: Bonfida Wallet, Sollet and Solong. Simply deposit funds in your favourite wallet as you would for an Ethereum-based wallet. To use them on Bonfida, click on the Connect button on the top right hand corner. There is a drop-down list there to select the wallet you’d want to use.    What is the difference between limit and market order?    A market order is an order to buy or sell a token immediately. This type of order guarantees that the order will be executed, but does not guarantee the execution price, it will be executed at the best price available. A limit order is an order to buy or sell an asset at a specific price. To know which to use refer to our dedicated section    What wallet can I connect?    You can connect several wallets:\n Sollet Bonfida wallet Solong wallet     How do I convert ERC20 tokens to SPL?    The easiest way to convert your ERC20 to SPL (or the other way around) is to use the native convert function of Sollet.io.    Why do I need to settle my funds?    After doing a trade on Serum you need to Settle your funds otherwise they sit in an intermediary account. To do this, you can either click on the Settle Button on the Trade page or on the balances pages.\nNote that you can enable auto-settle on the top right corner of the screen.\n   My balance did not update after my trade?     Make sure that the trade was executed and is not resting as an open order Make sure to settle your funds, otherwise, the trade won’t reflect in your balances     How can I list a market on Bonfida?
