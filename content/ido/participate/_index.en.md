**In order to bid during the IEO, make sure you read the rules below and do the following beforehand:**

- You will need to set-up a Solana-based wallet. You have the following options:

  - bonfida.com/wallet
  - solongwallet.com
  - Sollet.io

- You will need to have SOL in the wallet to pay for network fees/gas. To help you get started on Solana, we can airdrop SOL in your wallet. The airdrop can only be claimed once per SOL or IP address. You can also add more SOL to your wallet by either:
  - Depositing SOL
  - Connecting to MetaMask for an ETH to SOL conversion (only for sollet and Bonfida’s wallet)
  - Fund your wallet with USDT

### How the IEO will work:

Set an alarm in advance: the IEO starts on February 1st, 21:45 SGT.

- A MAPS/USDT market will be listed on Bonfida.
- You have **15 minutes** to place bids on the orderbook between February 1st, 21:45 SGT - February 1st, 22:00 SGT. You can bid at any price that you think is reasonable (min bid is $0.10/MAPS).
- Between February 1st, 22:00 - 22:01 SGT, 2,000,000 MAPS tokens will be market sold in this market, and so the top bids in the orderbook will be filled.
- You will need to cancel any unfilled open orders after the allocations are announced.

There is no guarantee of your right to participate in the IEO or to receive any allocation.
