### What is the difference between OXYPOOL and OXY?

OXYPOOL refers to the VC POOL of Oxygen. This is a pool that is locked for one year.

### Whats the quickest way to fund your Bonfida or Sollet wallet for the IDO?

- FTX: Send any token as SPL to your wallet.
- Binance: Purchase SOL on Binance -> Send SOL as SPL to your wallet -> Sell SOL on DEX (SOL/USDC)

This method will reduce the fees you pay on the ETH network.
